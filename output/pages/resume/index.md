Hi! I’m Brian Reich.  First things first: thanks for taking the time to review my resumé. Out of all the AI slop that crosses your screen today, I hope this unique, hand-crafted and fully human-generated slop stands out from the rest.

At my core I am a problem solver. I fell in love with programming, and the web, early in life. At this stage in my career, I’ve learned to focus on values and less on tools and languages.

I value consistency, quality, speed, autonomy, and creativity. I’m at my best in an organization that understands those values are not in conflict. I believe teams should self-organize, communicate, and adopt a process that works for _them_. Today, I think that process usually looks a lot like Continuous Delivery, XP, and the practices found in shops that practice them. I value simplicity, testing, iteration, and understanding and adapting my approach to software to fit within the business context. I like an intellectual challenge. I think experimentation is important,  and throwing code away is fine as long as you learn something. I like working in an organization that lets me out of the code-monkey pen to think about the bigger picture.

I’ve spent the last 6 years of my career growing from IC to leadership. I’ve managed a legacy SaaS project. I’ve balanced modernization with business needs. I’ve led a massive security remediation effort. I knocked down the silos within our organization to build features based on stakeholder input, versus speculative features our customers won’t use.  I supported and mentored my team. I aggressively cut cloud costs to the tune of about 40% per month.

I’m incredibly proud of the work I’ve done, and I planned to keep doing it. But as it turns out, “_acquisitions are a thing._”  When the small company I worked for was acquired, nobody “moved my cheese,” but the cheese sure got harder to swallow. And so I’m seeking my next adventure, free from the bounds of a Private Equity firm’s org chart that causes out of memory errors if you try to follow it.  

Thanks for your time, and I hope you’ll consider me for your team.

Sincerely,  
Brian Reich

# **EDUCATION**

## **Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg, PA** _\- BS Computer Science_

September 2002 -May 2006

Bloomsburg’s program was very practical. I was exposed to many programming languages including C, C++, x86 Assembly, and SQL. We leaned deep  into Java, which shaped my personal coding style.  As a result I love OOP, have a deep fondness for design patterns, prefer composition over inheritance, and embrace the concepts of clean code and clean engineering.
