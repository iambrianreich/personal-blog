Hi! I'm Brian Reich. Formerly of Reich Web Consulting. Currently Software Development Manager at CORE Business Solutions. I'm a technical manager, recovering individual contributor, husband, dad, casual farmer, and some other stuff you likely don't care too much about.

I hate social media. I love writing. Sometimes it feels good to share my thoughts with other people. So here I am, once again asking you to contribute your time to listen to my brain droppings.

My goal with this blog is to write about things that matter to me. That includes programming, and the art and science of being a technical manager. It includes musings on the state of the world. And it includes talking about my hobbies and passions, like woodworking and gardening.

I'll do my best to separate different kinds of content so you can find what you care about.
