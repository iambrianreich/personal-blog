title: "Building a Home File Server with Pi 5 with Cheap Cloud Backup"

Most tech folks have the experience of our side projects giving us education, experience, and ideas that we bring to with us. This week I did just the opposite.

Over the last few years I've learned a lot about Linux administration as well as AWS. When I realized I needed to come up with a fast and cheap file storage solution for personal use, I didn't have to get real creative, because my work already gave me the knowledge to do something.

# The Problem

My wife has a lot of photos. Like, _a lot_. She has JPEGs going back to high school because, unlike my old ass, smart phones existed when she was in high school. Hundreds of pictures from college. A handful from our dating years, and then once the kids came along... _hoo boy_ are there some pictures.

She started having problems a few years ago when her iCloud account ran out of space. We increased her storage, but that only helped for so long. Then we started moving photos to her computer. Then when her computer started failing, I moved everything to _my_ computer.

Now my computer, having served me well for a decade, is about to become a victim of Microsoft ending support for Windows 10
