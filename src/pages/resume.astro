      <p>
        Hi! I'm Brian Reich. First things first: thanks for taking the time to review my resumé.
        Out of all the AI slop that crosses your screen today, I hope this unique, hand-crafted
        and fully human-generated slop stands out from the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        At my core I am a problem solver. I fell in love with programming, and the web, early in life.
        At this stage in my career, I've learned to focus on values and less on tools and languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value consistency, quality, speed, autonomy, and creativity. I'm at my best in an organization
        that understands those values are not in conflict. I believe teams should self-organize, communicate,
        and adopt a process that works for <em>them</em>. Today, I think that process usually looks a lot like
        Continuous Delivery, XP, and the practices found in shops that practice them. I value simplicity,
        testing, iteration, and understanding and adapting my approach to software to fit within the business context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've spent the last 6 years of my career growing from IC to leadership. I've managed a legacy SaaS project.
        I've balanced modernization with business needs. I've led a massive security remediation effort. I knocked
        down the silos within our organization to build features based on stakeholder input, versus speculative
        features our customers won't use. I supported and mentored my team. I aggressively cut cloud costs by about 40%.

        <p class="job-dates">September 2002 – May 2006</p>
        <p>
          Bloomsburg's program was very practical. I was exposed to many programming languages including
          C, C++, x86 Assembly, and SQL. We leaned deep into Java, which shaped my personal coding style.
          As a result I love OOP, have a deep fondness for design patterns, prefer composition over inheritance,
          and embrace the concepts of clean code and clean engineering.
