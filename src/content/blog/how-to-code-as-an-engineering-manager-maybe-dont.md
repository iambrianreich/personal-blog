So, you're an engineering manager.  Your backlog seems overwhelming.  You think "what better way to support my team than to pick a ticket and reduce their workload?
*You could*. But stop for a moment and consider *if you should*.
## Maker's Schedule vs. Manager Schedule.
You assign yourself a ticket from the critical path.
Then what happens? You start with good intentions. But then you get distracted. In the negative space between meetings, you just barely have time to *remember what you did last time.* Three weeks later you haven't completed the ticket.
Not only have you *not helped your team,* you've actually let them down by making an agreement you couldn't keep, and preventing on-time delivery.
[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) is as true today as it was on the day it was written. To sum it up: programming takes time and focus. Programmers need the freedom to ignore distractions. In contrast, a manager's schedule is all about distractions: a project meeting here, a presentation to leadership there, one-on-ones, agile ceremonies, "unsticking" individual contributors.

## But I Really Want to Code!
I know, right?
**Coding is my happy place. ** Marking something *Done* can mean the difference between an emotionally draining day with nothing to show for itself, versus logging out with a sense of accomplishment. Let's face it: even the worst requirements document still defines *Done* better than most management responsibilities. 
But that's not a good reason to pick a ticket and risk breaking your team's agreement to deliver something.
So to scratch your itch, here are some suggestions:
- **Don't assign yourself work on the critical path. **I'm just repeating this again, in case it didn't sink in. You mean well, but this is a *the road to Hell is paved with good intentions* kind of a situation. If you want it released on time, assign it to someone else.
- **Select low-effort technical debt**. Tech debt tasks such as cleaning up a smelly slice of code, refactors, test enhancement, and documentation, are often small tasks you can fit into the margins in your schedule, aren't blocking others, and will help the team in the future.
- **Experiment. ** Is there an internal tool that would improve your team's experience? Is there a process that could be automated?  Go get started! A recent example from my team is a tool I built that monitors Jira, GitHub, and other tools and sends each team member a morning email to remind them of their obligations for the day, like PR assignments. It fit into the margins of my week just fine.Just be aware that your team may get jealous if they see you plucking the "interesting" projects and leave them picking up scraps.
- **Defragment your calendar. **If you really want to code, spend some time defragmenting your calendar. Basically, try to rearrange your planned engagements to be patched together with less empty space between them. A successfully defragmented calendar looks like large blocks of meetings (boo!) with large blocks of free space as a result. (yay!) Working for an organization that's willing to embrace this concept collectively definitely helps.
*Now the obligatory throat clearing: *this is just a recommendation I've found works in my experience. I don't always get it right. But when the urge strikes to raise my hand and say "I'll look into that" I reflect on whether or not I actually have the time.
