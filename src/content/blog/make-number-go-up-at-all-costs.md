Twice this decade, I've had to learn hard lessons about "_growth at all costs._"

From 2014 to 2019, I freelanced full-time. I truly enjoyed my life. The flexibility, the autonomy, the variety of projects that crossed my desk. **I was happy**. But about the time we started a family, I started feeling like I plateaued as a freelancer. I could see no path forward for offering the same services, to the same people, and continuing to grow.

**Did I have to grow?** Come to think of it, _I didn't stop to ask._ I always just assumed growth, specifically in terms of "dollars earned per unit of time," was always a thing to be measured and maximized.

So I grew. I grew by hiring people I could afford, not the people I needed to round myself out. I found myself babysitting projects, accounts, and people. I was in the business of being in business, and I no longer enjoyed it. It wasn't long after that my wife's work situation changed and I had to figure out health insurance.

**Chasing growth had killed my love for my business**, and it was a good time for a change. I took a job at a local company, as a senior web developer.

Over the past six years, _I once again chased growth_. Not in terms of compensation but in terms of responsibility. Senior developer to team lead, to manager, to director. I've learned a lot. But I loved being a developer. Diluting my day with everything else was starting to kill my love of work again.

Meanwhile: much like myself a few years prior, our owner couldn't figure out a way to grow our business without either taking on debt, or taking on a partner, which I eventually realized was just a _sales-truth euphemism_ for "selling the company."

We were acquired. In some ways things got more interesting. But's a constant squeeze for _mo_re, and life inside a team, inside a company, inside another company, inside a private equity portfolio leaves very little room for misunderstanding the mission: _make number go up at all costs_. _[EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp) is your god now._

What have I learned?

- **I love my work until I lose sight of the things I love about it:** problem solving, making cool stuff, building relationships with people and helping them solve their problems.

- **I don't need to be rich.** I need an income can that support my family.

- I need to learn contentment.

In the first scenario, I designed by own undoing by pursuing growth I didn't need. In the second, I was roadside carnage in someone else's fucked-up growth journey. Neither needed to happen.
